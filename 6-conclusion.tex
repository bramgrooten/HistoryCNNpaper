Although there is much more to say about the history and development of convolutional neural networks, I hope this paper has answered some of basic questions. We have seen the fundamental structure of a ConvNet, and learned about the early contributors. The important convolution operation was discussed in detail, and multiple practical applications have been reviewed. Taking the fast developments of the deep learning field into account, I think there is a lot more ConvNet history about to be made.
