\section{Introduction}

In deep learning, which is a subfield of artificial intelligence \cite[Ch. 1]{dl-book}, % page 9
different kinds of artificial neural networks are used for numerous applications. This paper will look at the history of a specific type of network: the convolutional neural network (ConvNet). The main goal is to discover the mathematical foundations of ConvNets and describe the corresponding historical development. Other questions that we will explore throughout the paper are: What is a ConvNet? Who invented it? What are the applications? The answers will always be given with an overview on the historical perspective.
