In deep learning, which is a subfield of artificial intelligence \cite[Ch. 1]{dl-book}, % page 9
different kinds of artificial neural networks are used for numerous applications. This paper will look at the history of a specific type of network: the convolutional neural network (ConvNet). The main goal is to discover the workings of the main mathematical foundation of a ConvNet and describe the corresponding historical development. Other questions that we will explore throughout the paper are: What is a ConvNet? Who invented it? What are the applications? The answers will always be given with a connection to the historical perspective.\\
